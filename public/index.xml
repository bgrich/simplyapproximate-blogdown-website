      <description>Welcome to the latest version of Simply Approximate! Over the the last few years I’ve had grand plans to make use of this site. Alas, work and other concerns have prevented me from posting anything and getting this blog off the ground. But now is the time! To give the blog a fresh start, I’ve decided to re-build the site and re-launch it using Blogdown.
Blogdown is package for R created by Yihui Xie that allows for the creation and maintain of a website inside of R Studio.</description>

      <description>I am a Data Scientist, Physicist, and R enthusiast. These are my thoughts on Physics, Data Science, games, books, dance, and culture. Expect an occasionally updated collection of random ramblings on whatever holds my interest at the moment.
What do I mean by Simply Approximate?Simply Approximate is the idea that the models we create of the world are merely the best approximations we can make. As such, our models are constantly changing and updating as we receive new information.</description>
