  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>On December 8th, 2017, I noticed that my Twitter feed was blowing up about the <a href="https://blog.patreon.com/updating-patreons-fee-structure/">new changes coming to Patreon</a>. The big change that has people nervous is this: starting in late December, Patreon patrons will have to start paying for credit card service fees. This is a change over the previous system where all fees were taken out of the amount the creator received directly. While overall a switch to charging the patrons the transaction fees doesn’t seem like a huge change, the deeper change of interest (to me) is the disaggregation of the transaction fees.</p>
<p>The trait that made Patreon different from other services was that you could aggregate the transaction fees. With any credit card transaction, there is typically a fee of some percentage of the charge plus a standard cost. For Patreon, this was a 1.9% + $0.30 fee that was subtracted from the money sent to the creators. This was done once a month for all of your pledges, so if you pledge to a number of different creators the transaction fee would be spread across them. Under the new system, Patreon is going to charge a 2.9% + $0.35 on top of each pledge made. This means that a person that pledges $1 to 10 different creators is going to be paying a $3.79 transaction fee where previously that fee was $0.64.</p>
<p>There are a few major concerns in the community regarding this. Some of the main ones being that many creators make their money from small pledges and the additional service fee might make those patrons leave. Some patrons may only have so much they can spend on Patreon per month, so those patrons may drop some of their small pledges or leave the platform entirely.</p>
<p>When I first read about this, I didn’t realize that they were going to disaggregate the pledge payments. But then I saw this Twitter post from @FoldableHuman that included a picture from the updated Patreon blog post about the changes:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The *weirdest* moment is when they put this image up and say &quot;look at how simple this will be in the future!&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m sorry, but tracking anywhere from 3 to 15 billing cycles isn&#39;t a simplification. <a href="https://t.co/WjVv9HsLPc">pic.twitter.com/WjVv9HsLPc</a></p>&mdash; Dan &quot;fascism is a loser ideology&quot; Olson (@FoldableHuman) <a href="https://twitter.com/FoldableHuman/status/939007425188847616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>That image was my first hint that Patreon was disaggregating the transaction fee in addition to having the patrons pay for it. I also saw a nice figure by @DarwinAwdWinner showing how much of what the patron is paying for a $1 pledge goes to the transaction fee, the Patreon cut, and the creator cut:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#39;s the percentage breakdown for a $1 pledge: <a href="https://t.co/plKJHZ6Rdj">pic.twitter.com/plKJHZ6Rdj</a></p>&mdash; Ryan Thompson (@DarwinAwdWinner) <a href="https://twitter.com/DarwinAwdWinner/status/938837508552400896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>These two figure got me thinking. What are these changes doing to the power of each dollar I spend on the service?</p>
<p><em>Note that in the following section I will be talking about the percentage of the total money paid by the patron that is given to the creator</em></p>
<div id="leveraging-patrons-money" class="section level2">
<h2>Leveraging Patron’s Money</h2>
<p>After reading about the changes in Patreon’s subscription and fee structure, the following question came to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is the power of my money spent being reduced by the loss of fee aggregation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To figure that out, let’s do a calculation. For simplicity, I am going to only use the current Patreon fee of 5% and the current Stripe payment processing fee of 1.9% + $0.30 per transaction as that is most similar to the new proposed fee structure.</p>
<p>Under the old structure, Patreon would aggregate the fees for pledge transactions. What this means is that at the first of each month, they would charge your credit card only once for all of your pledges, subtract off the transaction fee, and then divide the remaining amount among the creators you pledged to (after taking their 5% cut).</p>
<p>Under the new system, Patreon removes the aggregation of fees and will charge your credit card for each pledge. This means that each pledge will feel the full brunt of the new transaction fee (2.9% + $0.35).</p>
<p>To understand how this affects the patron, we will look at a simplified example.</p>
<div id="old-system" class="section level3">
<h3>Old System</h3>
<p>Let us assume that the patron gives the same amount to each creator. For the old payment system, we could model it something like this.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>old_payment &lt;- function(pledge_amount, number_supported) {
  stripe_fee &lt;- pledge_amount * number_supported * 0.019 + 0.3
  patreon_cut &lt;- pledge_amount * 0.05
  
  breakdown &lt;- tibble(old_stripe_creator_cut = pledge_amount - stripe_fee / number_supported - patreon_cut, 
                    old_stripe_patron_paid = pledge_amount, 
                    old_stripe_creator_percent = (pledge_amount - stripe_fee / number_supported - patreon_cut) / pledge_amount * 100)  
}</code></pre>
<p>Here we say that the user pledges some amount to n creators. We can break down the amount the user pays and the amount the creator makes as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cut the creator made (after fees and Patreon cut)</li>
<li>The amount the patron paid</li>
<li>The percentage of money the creator gets from what the patron paid</li>
</ul>
<p>This last breakdown is the most important for me as it gives a hint to how much of the money the patron spends is actually going to the creator. Now, let’s calculate the breakdown over a range of pledges from $1 to $20 and a range of creators supported from 1 to 20.</p>
<p>We can plot the percentage of the patrons money that the creators will take home. First we will look at the percentage taken home as a function of the amount pledged. This plot is color coded for the number of creators supported.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2017-12-08-explaining-patreon-s-subscription-changes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Here we see that the percentage that the creator takes home compared to what the patron actually paid increases with the amount pledged. Additionally, as the number of creators supported increases, the percentage of low pledge amounts taken home drastically increases.</p>
<p>We can compare that to a plot of the percentage taken home by the creator as a function of the number of creators supported with color showing the amount of money pledged.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2017-12-08-explaining-patreon-s-subscription-changes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Again, we see a similar trend of increased percentages for more creators being supported.</p>
</div>
<div id="new-system" class="section level3">
<h3>New System</h3>
<p>Now, we want to calculate the same break down, but for the new system of subscriptions and transactions. A key note here, the amount pledged by the patron and the amount actually paid by the patron will be different. Under the new system, Patreon will add a 2.9% + $0.35 service fee onto every pledge and the pledges will be transacted separately.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>new_payment &lt;- function(pledge_amount, number_supported) {
  transaction_fee &lt;- pledge_amount * 0.029 + 0.35
  patreon_cut &lt;- pledge_amount * 0.05
  
  breakdown &lt;- tibble(new_creator_cut = pledge_amount - patreon_cut, 
                    new_patron_paid = pledge_amount + transaction_fee, 
                    new_creator_percent = (pledge_amount - patreon_cut) / new_patron_paid * 100)  
}</code></pre>
<p>As with the old system of payment, let’s calculate the breakdown over a range of pledges from $1 to $20 and a range of creators supported from 1 to 20.</p>
<p>We can recreate the figures above using the new calculation. First we will look at the percentage taken home as a function of the amount pledged. This plot is color coded for the number of creators supported.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2017-12-08-explaining-patreon-s-subscription-changes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Here we see that the percentage that the creator takes home compared to what the patron actually paid increases with increases in the amount pledged, just as in the old case. However, the number of creators supported is no longer coupled to the service fee. This means that there is no link between the percentage of amount paid by the patron that the creator takes home and the number of creators supported. This is seen here by all of the different color lines for the number of creators supported overlapping. The lines themselves were jittered so that the overlap would be clear.</p>
<p>This becomes even clearer when we look at the percentage of amount paid by the patron as a function of the number of creators supported.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2017-12-08-explaining-patreon-s-subscription-changes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now we have a flat line for each level. Disaggregating the user payments means that increasing the number of creators supported makes no change in the percent that creators take home from what the patrons pay.</p>
</div>
<div id="comparison" class="section level3">
<h3>Comparison</h3>
<p>Let’s put these side by side for easier comparison.</p>
<p>First, let’s take a look at the percentage of amount paid to the creator as a function of amount pledged for both systems.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2017-12-08-explaining-patreon-s-subscription-changes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Here it is clear that no matter how many creators you support under the new system, you still get a percentage very close to only supporting a single creator under the old system.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2017-12-08-explaining-patreon-s-subscription-changes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The story is similar here when looking as a function of the number of creators supported. As a patron, your money goes further for the creators the more creators you support under the old system. Under the new system, more of your money is going into fees if you support multiple creators with small pledges.</p>
<p>Let me say that again. <strong>In comparison to the old system, more of the patron’s money goes into fees if you support multiple creators with small pledges under the new system.</strong></p>
<p>Of course, my scenario above is a generalization. There are likely not patrons pledging the same value to all creators. Some are probably pledging more to some creators than others. However, any aggregation of the transaction fees is a benefit to the creators and the patrons both.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="a-note-on-patreons-reasoning" class="section level2">
<h2>A Note on Patreon’s Reasoning</h2>
<p>In reading through their blog post, I understand why Patreon made the decision that they did. Their decision stems from a desire to allow creators to require patrons to pay first before being able to access their rewards. But this apparently led to a problem of perceived double booking, where patrons got charged immediately and then were charged shortly after when the first of the month rolled around. To fix this problem, Patreon decided to switch to a new subscription system that removed the possibility to aggregate fees because every pledge would now be a separate subscription with its own transaction that occurred monthly depending on when you initially pledged. So if you pledged to four different creators, you now have four different transactions instead of all of the transactions being aggregated into one.</p>
<p>In Patreon’s own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…we need to move our payments system to treat your pledges like <em>any other subscription</em> service. In other words, we need a system that charges patrons at the time of their initial pledge, and on the anniversary of their pledge each month thereafter.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, the part where they have gone wrong on this is that Patreon isn’t like any other subscription service. It is an opportunity for creators to get direct help from their fans and make use of large fan bases that might not be able to pay large amounts of money. By aggregating the transaction fees, they are able to help get more money into the pockets of the creators.</p>
<p>Patreon claims that they are doing this with intention of getting the most money for creators. I think that is a goal that everyone can agree on. But for me, my goal is to get as much money as I can directly to the creators. Small pledges are hard to make work because of the flat fee attached to transaction fees. By aggregating the transactions, Patreon helped make these work for creators. Under the new system, they aren’t encouraging me to seek out new creators to back. Doing so only hits me with more fees and doesn’t help the rest of the creators that I support.</p>
<p>I plan on continuing to support the creators that I already follow and I hope that these changes won’t hurt them too much. And who knows, this sounds like a great opportunity for a competitor to make a name for itself in the niche that Patreon has had a pretty strong hold of for several years.</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Recently, I came across a blog post by Tony Hirst on <a href="https://blog.ouseful.info/2017/11/15/programming-meh-lets-teach-how-to-write-computational-essays-instead/">computational essays and how they can be used to facilitate learning</a>. Hirst was reflecting on an earlier blog post by Stephen Wolfram on <a href="http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2017/11/what-is-a-computational-essay/">what defines a computational essay</a>. Computational essays are, as paraphrased from Hirst and Wolfram, a mixture of plain language, computer input, and computer output allowing the user to interweave narrative with code and the output from that code.</p>
<p>In reading the blog post by Hirst, I realized that I have been using computational essays on accident for several years. My first exposure to them was many years ago when using Mathematica in college. At the time, I didn’t quite understand the interface and soon moved to R when it was introduced to me in 2009. The release of R Markdown a few years later is when I truly began thinking in terms of computational essays.</p>
<p>As with using Mathematica, I didn’t quite understand the purpose of R Markdown at first. My first real use for R Markdown was for some calculations I was doing on the Stark effect in Rubidium. I found that interweaving the calculation code with some plain text explanations helped me keep track of the choices I was making in the code. More importantly, it provided documentation if I needed to share the code with anyone else in my lab. Prior to this, the documentation for my calculations was a mix of comments to explain the specifics of the code and separate documents (often handwritten) to explain the reasoning. Now I could combine them in the same place!</p>
<p>Soon after I started using R Markdown, I discovered that the file can be compiled as an html file. This allowed me to truly start thinking in terms of computational essays. Now, instead of sending my advisor an e-mail with a bunch of figures I could send a single html file with the figures and explanation combined in the same document. I also took that same html file and used it to present analysis results during lab meetings. Again, this put all of my figures in the same place along with descriptions of the analysis being done.</p>
<p>The only problem with a computational essay is the additional time it takes to prepare one. This is, of course, a feature as well. There is additional time required because you have to actually describe what you are doing for an audience that hasn’t spent every day for a month with the data.</p>
<p>This led me to one of my biggest revelations from using computational essays and a general trend I noticed while in graduate school. Any document that you plan to show someone who isn’t you has to be clear and concise. Figures with labels automatically generated from the data set might be fine for the person making the figure, but it will certainly be unintelligible for anyone reading the document. The document does not need to be journal publication ready, but it does need to be polished enough so that the author does not have to walk their audience through in person.</p>
<p>So, take the time to polish your work. Even if you think your audience will understand the shortcuts you’ve taken, that little bit of extra effort goes a long way to communicating your ideas.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Back in September I finished the Data Scientist (with R) career path from DataCamp. This career path is a series of 23 online courses that start with a general introduction to R, introduce the important functions and packages for modern R usage, and give a sampling of machine learning techniques. Along the way, these courses introduce data analysis concepts that go beyond the specifics of how to code in R.</p>
<p>I found the courses to be a mix of review and new material, however my 8 years of experience with R made the review portion of that inevitable. That being said, I almost always learned of some quirk in R or a new way of doing something that was simpler than the hack I’d been using for years. For someone new to R, these courses will be helpful in getting used to the quirks of R without having to bang your head against the wall too often.</p>
<p>After initially completing the courses I thought that they were interesting, but that their main use would be giving me brief introductions to topics for further study. In general, I’ve found that to be a pretty accurate assessment over the last few months. For example, while these courses gave me an introduction to the <code>purrr</code> package, it was only after reading through the package’s documentation and doing some tests of it myself that I was able to start to get a good grasp on the package. That being said, one of the more useful parts of the classes has been the ability to go back and review the material from the classes at a later date. While I may think I understood one of the topics, getting a chance to review it with a fresh problem in mind has been incredibly helpful.</p>
<p>Overall, I found the DataCamp courses to be pretty useful. Hopefully my time with them will continue to pay off in the coming months.</p>

    <p>Welcome to the latest version of Simply Approximate! Over the the last few years I’ve had grand plans to make use of this site. Alas, work and other concerns have prevented me from posting anything and getting this blog off the ground. But now is the time! To give the blog a fresh start, I’ve decided to re-build the site and re-launch it using Blogdown.</p>
<p><a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">Blogdown</a> is package for R created by Yihui Xie that allows for the creation and maintain of a website inside of R Studio. One of the things that has kept me from regularly making use of a blog is that I never became comfortable with the workflow for creating a post. Now with blogdown, I can do it all from within R Studio! Hopefully this will help me keep the website up and running for the near future.</p>
