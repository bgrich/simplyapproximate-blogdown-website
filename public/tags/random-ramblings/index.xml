      <description>On December 8th, 2017, I noticed that my Twitter feed was blowing up about the new changes coming to Patreon. The big change that has people nervous is this: starting in late December, Patreon patrons will have to start paying for credit card service fees. This is a change over the previous system where all fees were taken out of the amount the creator received directly. While overall a switch to charging the patrons the transaction fees doesnâ€™t seem like a huge change, the deeper change of interest (to me) is the disaggregation of the transaction fees.</description>
