I am a Data Scientist, Physicist, and R enthusiast. These are my thoughts on 
physics, data science, games, books, dance, and culture. Expect an occasionally 
updated collection of random ramblings on whatever holds my interest at the 
moment.

## What do I mean by **Simply Approximate**?

Simply Approximate is the idea that the models we create of the world are 
merely the best approximations we can make. As such, our models are 
constantly changing and updating as we receive new information.
