I am a Data Scientist, Physicist, and R enthusiast. These are my thoughts on 
Physics, Data Science, games, books, dance, and culture. Expect an occasionally

moment.

Simply Approximate is the idea that the models we create of the world are 
merely the best approximations we can make. As such, our models are 
constantly changing and updating as we receive new information.
