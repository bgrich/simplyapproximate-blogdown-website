<p>The goal of week 2 of #SoDS18 is to narrow down all of the plans made during the brainstorming sessions from week 1 and plan out how to accomplish those goals. I’ve decided to narrow it down to three main goals to be completed over the 3 months of #SoDS18. These goals are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Build an R Shiny app/dashboard</li>
<li>Complete a machine learning competition (and implement multiple models)</li>
<li>Learn about deep learning and implement a deep learning model</li>
</ol>

<p>Onto the lesson plan. In which Brian realizes he doesn’t know what he is doing!</p>

<h2>R Shiny</h2>
<p>As I stated in my previous post, I want to build an R Shiny app that makes use of some video game data. Particularly, making use of the Elite: Dangerous Database (EDDB). Here is my plan on how to tackle this project this summer. The following list will be my intended deadlines followed by my goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>6/12: Explore EDDB for fun data to work with.</li>
<li>6/12: Do some data exploration of the data set and figure out what I can make.</li>
<li>6/14: Outline what I want the app to do.</li>
<li>6/19: Read through the lessons/tutorials/manuals on the R Shiny site.</li>
<li>6/21: Create rough draft of the app layout.</li>
<li><strong>6/26: Build first draft of the app.</strong></li>
<li>6/27: Upload draft to shinyapps.io</li>
<li>7/2: Tweak app with suggestions.</li>
<li>7/2: Play with layout.</li>
<li><strong>7/6: Publish “final” version with a blog post.</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="machine-learning-competition" class="section level2">
<h2>Machine Learning Competition</h2>
<p>My next summer project is going to be completing a machine learning competition on Kaggle. Since I’ve already done a little bit of work on this, the start of it should be a little easier. I plan to do most of this work on Kaggle itself and release all of that work as a set of Kaggle kernels.</p>
<ul>
<li>7/10: Do data exploration of Titanic data.</li>
<li>7/13: Develop cleaning and preparation pipeline.</li>
<li><strong>7/17: Research different classifications models to use.</strong></li>
<li>7/19: Implement a glm model using caret.</li>
<li><strong>7/23: Implement other models for comparison.</strong></li>
<li>7/25: Visualize model results.</li>
<li><strong>7/27: Submit best model for scoring.</strong></li>
<li>7/31: Publish kernel’s and blog post with results.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="deep-learning" class="section level2">
<h2>Deep Learning</h2>
<p>This is probably the simplest and most complicated goal I have for the summer. After picking up Deep Learning for R several months ago, I want to finally read it and make use of deep learning in a model.</p>
<ul>
<li>8/22: Read <em>Deep Learning for R</em></li>
<li>9/3: Implement a deep learning model in the previous ML competition.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not sure how long all of these projects will take. Some of them might take longer than I planned. Some of them may go faster than I’ve planned. Should I make it through everything, I’ll probably do a second set of planning and pull out some of the projects that didn’t make it into the top 3.</p>
<p>If you want to stay updated on my progress, keep an eye on my Twitter account. Otherwise, I will be updating the blog near the conclusion of each project, though I may post something earlier if I come across anything particularly interesting.</p>
