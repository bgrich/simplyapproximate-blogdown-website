Starting earlier this week, I decided to particpate in the 
[Summer of Data Science 2018 (#SoDS18)](https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2018/05/28/summer-of-data-science-2018-sods18-launch-day/)!
Now that we are into June, I wanted to put up my first post about the Summer of
Data Science and my plans. The first week is supposed to be spent brainstorming 
and looking up resources, so here are some of my ideas. Starting in week 2, I 
will be nearrowing down my focus and making up a plan for the rest of the 
Summer.

## Shiny

One of the big things I want to work on is learning how R Shiny works. After 
having done a few R Shiny courses through DataCamp, I am going to work on an 
R Shiny app/dashboard from scratch. One of the side goals of this is to play 
around with some video game data, particularly the data from the 
[Elite: Dangerous Database](https://eddb.io/). Some of the resources I found 
for this include the DataCamp Shiny courses that I took as references and 
the official [R Shiny documentation and website](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).
