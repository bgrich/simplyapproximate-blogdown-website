On April 12th, 2018, Charlottesville and the Tom Tom Founders Festival played host to 
the second annual Applied Machine Learning Conference (AMLCville). I had the 
fortune to attend AMLCville and listen to talks on a wide range of topics and 
get to see the amazing ways that machine learning is being used out in the 
world. AMLCville was split into three different tracks with topic sessions on 
natural language processing, health care, computer vision, and geospatial 
analysis. 

I spent most of my time in the general interest sessions and attended the 
keynotes. The two big highlights for me were the keynote given by David Luebke 
of Nvidia on _Deep Learning and Computer Graphics_ and the talk by Renée Teate 
of HelioCampus on bias in machine learning titled _Can a Machine be Racist or Sexist?_

David Luebke's keynote gave an overview of the work Nvidia has been doing using 
deep learning for computer graphics. One of the examples that stood out to me 
was producing new mouth animations using audio files. By training a deep 
learning model using audio and motion capture, they were able to produce new 
mouth animations using only new audio files. While the new mouth animations 
weren't perfect, they went a long way to making the animated figure look like 
they were saying the words coming from the audio. I can't wait to see how this 
technology could be applied to games in the future. I can imagine that 
localizing games into new languages would benefit from the technology and 
hopefully lower the bar for localizations.

Renée Teate's talk gave an overview of the different ways that bias can impact 
machine learning. After her talk, Renée Teate moderated a panel discussion on 
bias in machine learning with a few of the other speakers that day. I think my 
favorite line came during the panel in which one of the panelists (Ines Montani 
I believe) reframed the often quoted phrase "your model is only as good as your 
data" as "your model can often be much worse than your data." A good reminder 
that, when building models, we need to make sure the model makes sense in 
addition to the data being good.

I'm quite excited to see data science and machine learning grow in 
Charlottesville. Since graduating and starting to dive into the data science 
community, it has been incredibly useful to have such a great resource within 
arms reach. Thank you to all of the organizers and speakers for putting on such 
a great conference!
