<p>Welcome to the latest version of Simply Approximate! Over the the last few years I’ve had grand plans to make use of this site. Alas, work and other concerns have prevented me from posting anything and getting this blog off the ground. But now is the time! To give the blog a fresh start, I’ve decided to re-build the site and re-launch it using Blogdown.</p>
<p><a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">Blogdown</a> is package for R created by Yihui Xie that allows for the creation and maintain of a website inside of R Studio. One of the things that has kept me from regularly making use of a blog is that I never became comfortable with the workflow for creating a post. Now with blogdown, I can do it all from within R Studio! Hopefully this will help me keep the website up and running for the near future.</p>
