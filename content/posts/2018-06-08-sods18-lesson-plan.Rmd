The goal of week 2 of #SoDS18 is to narrow down all of the plans made during 
the brainstorming sessions from week 1 and plan out how to accomplish those 
goals. I've decided to narrow it down to three main goals to be completed 
over the 3 months of #SoDS18. These goals are:

1. Build an R Shiny app/dashboard
2. Complete a machine learning competition (and implement multiple models)
3. Learn about deep learning and implement a deep learning model

Onto the lesson plan. In which Brian realizes he doesn't know what he is doing!

## R Shiny 

As I stated in my previous post, I want to build an R Shiny app that makes use 
of some video game data. Particularly, making use of the Elite: Dangerous 
Database (EDDB). Here is my plan on how to tackle this project this summer. The 
following list will be my intended deadlines followed by my goals.

* 6/12: Explore EDDB for fun data to work with.
* 6/12: Do some data exploration of the data set and figure out what I can make.
* 6/14: Outline what I want the app to do.
* 6/19: Read through the lessons/tutorials/manuals on the R Shiny site.
* 6/21: Create rough draft of the app layout.
* **6/26: Build first draft of the app.**
* 6/27: Upload draft to shinyapps.io
* 7/2: Tweak app with suggestions.
* 7/2: Play with layout.
* **7/6: Publish "final" version with a blog post.**
