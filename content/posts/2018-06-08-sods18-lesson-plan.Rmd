The goal of week 2 of #SoDS18 is to narrow down all of the plans made during 
the brainstorming sessions from week 1 and plan out how to accomplish those 
goals. I've decided to narrow it down to three main goals to be completed 
over the 3 months of #SoDS18. These goals are:

1. Build an R Shiny app/dashboard
2. Complete a machine learning competition (and implement multiple models)
3. Learn about deep learning and implement a deep learning model
