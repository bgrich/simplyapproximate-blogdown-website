## Leveraging User's Money

After reading about the changes in Patreon's subscription and fee structure, 
the following question came to me: 

> Is the power of my money spent being reduced by the loss of fee aggregation?

To figure that out, let's do a calculation. For simplicity, I am going to 
only use the current Patreon fee of 5% and the current Stripe payment processing 
fee of 1.9% + $0.30 per transaction as that is most similar to the new proposed 
fee structure.

```{r}
old_payment_stripe <- function(pledge_amount) {
  stripe_fee <- pledge_amount * 0.019 + 0.3
  patreon_cut <- pledge_amount * 0.05
  
  breakdown <- list(old_stripe_creator_cut = pledge_amount - stripe_fee - patreon_cut, 
                    old_stripe_patron_paid = pledge_amount, 
                    old_stripe_creator_percent = (pledge_amount - stripe_fee - patreon_cut) / pledge_amount)  
  return(breakdown)
}
```
