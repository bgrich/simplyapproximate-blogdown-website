<p>I am a Data Scientist, Physicist, and R enthusiast. These are my thoughts on Physics, Data Science, games, books, dance, and culture. Expect an occasionally updated collection of random ramblings on whatever holds my interest at the moment.</p>

<p>Simply Approximate is the idea that the models we create of the world are merely the best approximations we can make. As such, our models are constantly changing and updating as we receive new information.</p>
